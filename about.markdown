Hi, I'm Dinesh, an AgriTech operator with over 5 years of experience, currently working at the intersection of agricultural inputs and farm mechanization as **Manager - New Business** at an AgriTech company based in Bengaluru, India.

### A Quick Look Into My Career So Far

I began my career as a **Field Assistant** at an *agricultural input company* in October 2019.

In December 2020, I **founded** my own startup, *Farmer Amigo*, in Rural Bengaluru. At Farmer Amigo, I built farming communities where each group of 20 farmers was led by a farmer partner. This structure enabled us to efficiently deliver multiple services, starting with 24-hour delivery of agricultural inputs. We introduced a simple monthly farmer membership plan (â‚¹199/month) that included crop advisory, weather advisory, and door-delivery of agricultural inputs. The operations scaled to serve over 2,000 farmers before we had to pause in September 2022 due to funding constraints.

Subsequently, I moved to Delhi NCR to join a venture-backed agri-startup as part of their **Product team.** There, I developed farmer-facing products and led user research before returning to Bengaluru for my current role.

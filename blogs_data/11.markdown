My approach to life is centered around the idea that my life is a circle, within which I continuously gather dots of information. I don't control which dots I gather, and they often appear random or insignificant, but each one represents something meaningful. When the right moment comes, some of these dots connect, forming what I call a "circle of significance." Each circle of significance represents a key aspect of my life, whether personal or professional.<br><br>

These circles of significance are essential to my growth and to fulfilling various life purposes. Once a circle is formed, my focus shifts to adding more dots to it, connecting them in ways that lead to specific outcomes. Some circles hold greater importance than others, but each contributes to the overall structure of my life.<br><br>

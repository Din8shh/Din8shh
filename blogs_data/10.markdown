<h2 style="margin: 0;">Are there ways retailers manage cashflows that other agri businesses can learn from?</h2><dr>
<h6 style="color: #7D7D7D;" >September 2024</h6>
It's unfair to compare how retailers manage their cash flow to other agribusinesses.<br><br>

Retailers are able to manage their cash flows effectively because they get interest-free credit on agri input purchases from manufacturers.<br><br>

At present, retailers are extending that credit to their farmers in an informal way.<br><br>

However, this doesn't apply to subsidized fertilizers, as there is no credit facility available on subsidized fertilizers for retailers from manufacturers.<br><br>

The same is reflected on the ground also. In the majority of my interactions with farmers and retailers, I got to know that retailers don't provide credit to farmers on subsidized fertilizers, and farmers pay for it at the time of purchase.<br><br>

From this, we can understand that the actual reason why retailers were able to manage their cash flow effectively is because of the provisions they get from manufacturers; otherwise, it would be a straightforward cash-and-carry business.<br><br>

So, it's the majority of the agri input ecosystem that enables retailers to better manage their cash flows.<br><br>

Therefore, it's difficult to identify patterns in how agri input retailers manage their cash flow and link it to other agribusinesses.<br><br>
